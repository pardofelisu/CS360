1) Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
   - The app I chose to build was a simple event tracker, which required a database to hold login info of the user, a database that holds future events, and the ability to receive notifications from the app. This app is to address the need of having a calendar view of upcoming events for the user.
2) What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
   - I had to have 3 screens: the login page, the main calendar view page, and the homepage. I made these pages with simple buttons and no visual obstructions, alongside readable fonts. These features kept the users in mind by creating a very simple and easy to use app.
3) How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
   - I approached coding this app by breaking down each task into smaller, more manageable tasks. Doing this allowed me the proper time to dedicate to the development process as well as preventing me from becoming burned out. This strategy can be applied in the future by reminding me to take plenty of breaks and giving myself time to fully digest the task at hand.
4) How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
  - I tested my code in stages, often when I finished completing one of the 3 pages of the app. I did this in the Android Studio app, which gives an emulator of an android phone that shows you exactly what the app looks like and how it can be interacted with. This process is important to reveal possible bugs and oversights in the code.
5) Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  - I had to innovate during the initial planning process of the app, where I had to come up with a comprehensible and useful app that made sense to use. I had to make sure that my app stood out from the others on the market.
6) In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  - I was particularly successful in integrating the multiple databases within the app, as I have prior knowledge in SQL from prior classes. Being comfortable with this made the coding process much easier and faster.
